The present conscious instant is digital, the past and the future are quantum (analog). There is no universal frame of reference, instead, thereâ€™s only the conscious observerâ€™s frame of reference.

[TENET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet_(film)) is based on the physics of time, more specifically D-Theory of Time, or Digital Presentism, including the notion of ANTI-TIME around which the present article revolves. TENET's inversion is ANTI-TIME.
